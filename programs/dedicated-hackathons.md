# Dedicated Hackathons

Unlike the hackathons we're all used to, this is a no-cost program for assisting developers or small teams in building an MVP or PoC to solve a problem they identified inside their company.

In a nutshell, a developer could get free assistance from a team of Oracle cloud engineers/architects in solving a real-life use-case by using OCI and related technologies (Kubernetes, Docker, Functions, advanced networking, Java, etc). 

## How to qualify:
- [send an email here](mailto:bogdan.farca@oracle.com) briefly describing your use case,
- you may get a request for clarifications and/or additional details
- generic requests like "I just want to test for a while" are not valid use cases for this program,
- if accepted, a cloud engineer will reach back to deep dive into the case and establish the next steps

## What to expect
- a team of cloud architects/developers/DBAs will (virtually) spend some time assisting in building and tuning the MVP. More time if the case is interesting and fun,
- they are assisting and contributing but not doing the work for you,
- the MVP should use Oracle Cloud and fit into the Free Trial limits,
- there is no sales follow-up or commitment
