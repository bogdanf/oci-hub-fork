# Support for side projects

This is a developer-oriented program meant to support developers' side projects. 

It's based on Oracle Cloud's free-tier program, providing (resources can be used indefinitely):

- Compute: 2 VMs with 1 oCPU and 1GB memory each
- Storage: 2x Block Volumes, 100GB Total. 10GB Object Storage. 10GB Archive Storage
- Databases: 2x Databases (ADWH/ATP), each with 1 oCPU and 20GB Storage
- Additional Services:
  - Load Balancer: 1 instance, 10Mbps
  - Monitoring: 500 million ingestion datapoints, 1 billion retrieval datapoints.
  - Notifications: 1 million sent through https per month, 1000 sent through email per month.
  - Outbound Data Transfer: 10TB per month

See the current free allowance [here](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/) or [here](http://www.oracle.com/us/what-can-i-do-with-300-in-credits-3746781.pdf).

Part of the `Oracle Digital for Developers` initiative, therefore signing with [this link][1] will grant access to technical resources. Nobody will reach out as a result of this interaction.  

## Why 
- Free cloud powerful enough to support most small workloads, on a 24x7 basis, not limited in time
- No mandatory technology and no lockdown (most of the services can also run on-premise or on other clouds)
- Developer-oriented free migration/architectural help (cloud engineer)
- There is a clear assisted-growth path if the side project takes off (Free tier → Oracle for Startups → Oracle for ISVs → Global Enterprise level)

## How to qualify
- Register for an Oracle trial/free tier using the [special link provided][1]
- If needed, schedule a virtual meeting with a cloud engineer to assess the best technological approach and next steps
- If needed, enroll in the free cloud virtual classrooms to get some additional guidance
- Deploy / migrate your workload and make sure it works
- When more than the free tier is needed, enroll in the [Oracle for Startups](https://www.oracle.com/startup/) program to expand the free options and growth hacking.
