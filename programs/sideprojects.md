# Support for side projects

## Description

This is a developer-oriented program meant to support developers' side projects. 

It's based on Oracle Cloud's free-tier program, providing 2 VMs, one load balancer, 2 cloud-hosted databases with 20GB storage each and 10TB monthly outband traffic, among others (see [here](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/) or [here](http://www.oracle.com/us/what-can-i-do-with-300-in-credits-3746781.pdf) the current configuration).

Part of the `Oracle Digital for Developers` initiative, therefore signing with [this link][1] tunes any further interaction to a technical only audience.

## Why 
- Free cloud powerful enough to support most small workloads, on a 24x7 basis, not limited in time
- No mandatory technology and no lockdown (most of the services can also run on-premise or on other clouds)
- Developer-oriented free migration/architectural help (cloud engineer)
- There is a clear assisted-growth path if the side project takes off (Free tier → Oracle for Startups → Oracle for ISVs → Global Enterprise level)

## How to qualify
- Register for an Oracle trial/free tier using the [special link provided][1]
- If needed, schedule a virtual meeting with a cloud engineer to assess the best technological approach and next steps
- If needed, enroll in the free cloud virtual classrooms to get some additional guidance
- Deploy / migrate your workload and make sure it works
- When more than the free tier is needed, enroll in the [Oracle for Startups](https://www.oracle.com/startup/) program to expand the free options and growth hacking.
